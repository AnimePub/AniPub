      <h1>AniPub Terms and Conditions</h1>
  <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: September 02, 2025</p>

  <p>Welcome to AniPub ("we," "us," or "our"), an open-source, community-driven platform for watching, saving, downloading, and curating anime content. AniPub is built using Node.js and is designed to be ad-free, tracker-free, and privacy-first, providing a seamless experience for anime enthusiasts. By accessing or using AniPub (the "Service"), including any associated websites, applications, or features (such as streaming, playlists, ratings, and upcoming comment sections), you agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, you must not access or use the Service.</p>

  <p>These Terms apply to all users of the Service, including visitors, registered users, contributors, and donors. AniPub is provided under the GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPL v3), which governs the use, modification, and distribution of the underlying software available at <a href="https://github.com/AnimePub/AniPub">https://github.com/AnimePub/AniPub</a>. However, these Terms specifically address your use of the hosted Service, including any cloud-hosted instances on platforms like Railway or Render.</p>

  <h2>1. Eligibility and Account Registration</h2>
  <p>To use certain features of the Service, such as creating accounts, saving anime, downloading content, creating playlists, or participating in community features (e.g., ratings and comments), you must register for an account. You represent and warrant that:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You are at least 18 years old or the age of majority in your jurisdiction, whichever is higher. If you are under the age of majority, you must have the consent of a parent or legal guardian to use the Service.</li>
    <li>All information you provide during registration is accurate, complete, and current.</li>
    <li>You will maintain the accuracy of such information and promptly update it as necessary.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Accounts are secured using JWT authentication, hashed passwords, and session controls. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for all activities that occur under your account. You must notify us immediately of any unauthorized use or security breach. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account if we suspect any violation of these Terms or for any other reason in our sole discretion.</p>
  <p>AniPub does not require or collect unnecessary personal information beyond what is needed for account functionality, in line with our privacy-first commitment. For details on data handling, refer to our Privacy Policy (available upon request or to be linked here when implemented).</p>

  <h2>2. Use of the Service</h2>
  <h3>2.1 Permitted Use</h3>
  <p>You may use the Service for personal, non-commercial purposes only, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Streaming anime in high-quality playback.</li>
    <li>Saving and downloading anime for offline viewing (subject to content availability and legal restrictions).</li>
    <li>Creating and sharing playlists.</li>
    <li>Rating anime and connecting with other users.</li>
    <li>Participating in community discussions (e.g., comments, once implemented).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The Service is provided "as is" and relies on community contributions and open-source development. Features like OAuth integration and advanced recommendation engines may be added in future updates.</p>

  <h3>2.2 Prohibited Activities</h3>
  <p>You agree not to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Use the Service for any illegal purpose or in violation of any local, state, national, or international law, including copyright or intellectual property laws.</li>
    <li>Upload, post, or share any content that is harmful, abusive, obscene, defamatory, discriminatory, or otherwise objectionable.</li>
    <li>Engage in data mining, scraping, or automated access to the Service without our prior written consent (except as permitted under GPL v3 for the software itself).</li>
    <li>Introduce viruses, malware, or any code that could harm the Service or other users.</li>
    <li>Attempt to reverse-engineer, decompile, or interfere with the Service's security features, including JWT authentication or HTTPS protocols.</li>
    <li>Use the Service to distribute or promote pirated content, unless you have the legal right to do so. AniPub does not host or endorse unauthorized content; any streaming or downloading is at your own risk and responsibility.</li>
    <li>Impersonate any person or entity, or misrepresent your affiliation with any person or entity.</li>
    <li>Overload, flood, or spam the Service, including through excessive requests or denial-of-service attacks.</li>
    <li>Commercialize the Service without our express permission, such as reselling access or incorporating it into a paid product.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We monitor the Service for compliance and may remove content or restrict access without notice if we determine a violation has occurred.</p>

  <h3>2.3 Content Availability</h3>
  <p>Anime content on AniPub is sourced from publicly available or community-contributed sources. We do not guarantee the availability, quality, or legality of any content. Content may be removed or become unavailable at any time due to third-party actions, technical issues, or legal requirements. Downloads are for personal use only and must comply with applicable copyright laws in your jurisdiction.</p>

  <h2>3. Intellectual Property</h2>
  <h3>3.1 Our Rights</h3>
  <p>The Service, including its software, user interface (powered by EJS, custom CSS, and JavaScript), and any original content we create, is owned by AniPub and its contributors under GPL v3. You may use, modify, and distribute the software as permitted by the license, but you must comply with its terms (e.g., sharing modifications under the same license).</p>

  <h3>3.2 User-Generated Content</h3>
  <p>By submitting content to the Service (e.g., playlists, ratings, comments), you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual license to use, reproduce, modify, distribute, and display such content in connection with the Service. You represent that you have all necessary rights to grant this license and that your content does not infringe third-party rights.</p>
  <p>We are not responsible for user-generated content and disclaim any liability for it. We may, but are not obligated to, review, edit, or remove such content.</p>

  <h3>3.3 Third-Party Content</h3>
  <p>Anime and related media on the Service may be protected by copyrights owned by third parties (e.g., studios, distributors). Your use of such content must comply with fair use doctrines or obtain necessary permissions. AniPub does not claim ownership over third-party content and provides it for informational and entertainment purposes only.</p>

  <h2>4. Privacy and Data Security</h2>
  <p>AniPub is committed to privacy: We do not display ads, track user activity, or sell data. We use MongoDB for secure storage and implement measures like hashed passwords and secure sessions. However, no system is infallible. By using the Service, you acknowledge that we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>
  <p>For donations processed via AniPub Live, third-party payment processors may apply their own terms and privacy policies.</p>

  <h2>5. Disclaimers and Limitations of Liability</h2>
  <p>THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>
  <p>WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR-FREE, SECURE, OR FREE FROM VIRUSES. YOU USE THE SERVICE AT YOUR OWN RISK.</p>
  <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANIPUB, ITS CONTRIBUTORS, AND AFFILIATES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE, INCLUDING LOSS OF DATA, PROFITS, OR GOODWILL, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>
  <p>OUR TOTAL LIABILITY SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU PAID US IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS (WHICH IS ZERO FOR FREE USERS). SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR LIABILITY, SO THESE MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>

  <h2>6. Indemnification</h2>
  <p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless AniPub, its contributors, officers, directors, employees, and agents from any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising from your use of the Service, violation of these Terms, or infringement of third-party rights.</p>

  <h2>7. Termination</h2>
  <p>We may terminate or suspend your access to the Service at any time, without notice or liability, for any reason, including breach of these Terms. Upon termination, your right to use the Service ceases immediately. Provisions that by their nature should survive termination (e.g., disclaimers, indemnification) will remain in effect.</p>

  <h2>8. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h2>
  <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the United States, without regard to conflict of laws principles. Any disputes arising from these Terms or the Service shall be resolved exclusively in the state or federal courts located in California, USA, and you consent to personal jurisdiction therein.</p>
  <p>For open-source disputes related to GPL v3, refer to the license terms.</p>

  <h2>9. Changes to These Terms</h2>
  <p>We may update these Terms at any time. We will notify you of material changes by posting the revised Terms on the Service or via email (if provided). Your continued use after the effective date constitutes acceptance of the changes. If you do not agree, you must stop using the Service.</p>

  <h2>10. Miscellaneous</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Severability:</strong> If any provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions remain in full effect.</li>
    <li><strong>Waiver:</strong> Our failure to enforce any right does not constitute a waiver.</li>
    <li><strong>Assignment:</strong> We may assign these Terms without your consent; you may not assign without our written approval.</li>
    <li><strong>Entire Agreement:</strong> These Terms, along with the GPL v3 license and any linked policies, constitute the entire agreement between you and us.</li>
    <li><strong>Force Majeure:</strong> We are not liable for delays or failures due to events beyond our control (e.g., natural disasters, cyber-attacks).</li>
  </ul>
