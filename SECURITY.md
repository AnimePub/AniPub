## 🔐 How We Protect You

- **Password Security:** All passwords are securely hashed before storage—never stored in plain text.
- **Authentication:** JWT-based authentication for user sessions and OAuth supported !
- **Session Management:** Only you can access your account. Inactivity triggers session expiration.
- **Data Transmission:** All data is encrypted using HTTPS.
- **Access Control:** Strict permission checks on all user actions.
- **Regular Updates:** Dependencies and code are reviewed and updated frequently for security.
- **No Sensitive Data Sharing:** We never sell or share your personal data.

- Do not attempt to access or modify accounts or data that does not belong to you.
- Do not run automated or denial-of-service attacks.
- Give us reasonable time to respond before any public disclosure.
- Be respectful and ethical in your actions and communication.
